# Summary
I have been a Salesforce developer since 2020. I graduated from medical university in 2005 and worked as a doctor. Then my friend called me to Salesforce. I studied HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, Apex in a company course. I also used Salesforce frameworks (Visualforce, Aura, LWC), Cypress, Python and other in my work. A few months ago, I read a RS mentor's tweet and wanted to take a front-end developer course.
